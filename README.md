  * learn by reverse engineering, through you might make some wrong assumptions this way
* kodeco's site: https://www.kodeco.com/2606-bullet-physics-tutorial-getting-started
  * good introduction, focuses on mobile development, not publicly editable
* gamedesigning.org's comments on bullet physics: https://www.gamedesigning.org/engines/bullet/
  * more of a commentary and less of manual on how to use bullet,  not publicly editable
